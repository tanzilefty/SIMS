# 🎓 Student Information Management System (SIMS)

A simple, browser-based **Student Information Management System (SIMS)** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. This project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates how to manage student data without any backend or database.


## 📌 Project Overview

SIMS is a lightweight web application that allows:

- **Admins** to manage student records
- **Students** to view their academic results

The system runs entirely in the browser using **localStorage**, so no server or database is required.


## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Authentication System
- Role-based login (Admin / Student)
- Admin login with username & password
- Student login using Student ID
- Session handling using `localStorage`

### 👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard
- ➕ Add new students
- 📝 Assign marks & auto-generate grades
- 📋 View all students
- ❌ Delete student records

### 👨‍🎓 Student Dashboard
- View personal information
- View marks and grades
- "No Result Found" message if not assigned


## 🧮 Grade System

| Marks Range | Grade | Performance |
|------------|------|------------|
| 80 - 100   | A+   | Excellent  |
| 70 - 79    | A    | Very Good  |
| 60 - 69    | B    | Good       |
| 50 - 59    | C    | Satisfactory |
| Below 50   | F    | Needs Improvement |
